# Categorical Word Storage

A simple Discord Bot written in Python. 
The primary function of the bot is to store Words/Labels from different Categories to have them accessible all the time.

For instance you can store all countries of the world in the category "countries".
And then you could request all countries starting with the letter "C" or request all countries regardless their first character.
